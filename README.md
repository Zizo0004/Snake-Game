## Description
This is a simple Snake game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective of the game is to control the snake, guiding it to eat fruits that appear on the screen. Each time the snake eats a fruit, it grows longer. However, if the snake touches the borders of the game area or if its head collides with its body, the game is over.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.

## How to Play

2. Guide the snake to eat the fruits that appear on the screen.
3. Avoid letting the snake touch the borders of the game area or collide with its own body.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with the borders or itself.
